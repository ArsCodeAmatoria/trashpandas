        "High-key candy-glass daylight, harmonized saturation, botanical order. The lie reads cheerful—control wears a festival face.",

      title: "Iris on top (framing wins)",
      body:
        "Deep desaturated purple in shadow bias and ambient lift—plum, bruised petal, ink violet. Cooler, quieter contrast; velvet “whisper you can’t source.” Pretty enough to avoid evil-dungeon reads; no neon purple villainy.",

      title: "Rose on top (truth leads)",
      body:
        "Warmer keys; gentle red in skintone paths, practicals, petal reflections—aliveness and pulse, not alarm. Teach warmth early in off-system gold/green so red never equals “danger girl.” Reserve hard red for machine panic / redline reads, not her victory.",

    {
      title: "Edelweiss / machine",
      body:
        "Sterile whites, glass cyan, clinical green diagnostics—precision cold. Separate from Iris purple: ideology as instrument, not rumor.",

        "Chartreuse and yellow-green in edge paths, foliage bounce, wardrobe accents—photosynthetic, unruly counterweight to Iris purple and machine cyan.",

      title: "Narcissa / spectacle",
      body:
        "Magenta-gold follow-spot and bloom trim while “Look at Me” holds. When the mask cracks: drain toward ash-rose and desaturated pink—glamour tiring, not moral green.",

      title: "Waterfall / off-system",

        "Gold hour bounce + clean blue air—natural key distinct from district harmony and from Iris haze.",

      title: "Discipline",

        "Stylize for memory, not wallpaper. Iris and Rose looks land hardest when each has two or three iconic corridors or rooms; elsewhere keep read simple: cool secret talk vs warm honest air.",
